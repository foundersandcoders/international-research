### what
A spike is a product-testing method originating from Extreme Programming that uses the simplest possible program to explore potential solutions.
 * Extreme programming (XP) is a software development methodology which is intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements. As a type of agile software development,it advocates frequent "releases" in short development cycles, which is intended to improve productivity and introduce checkpoints at which new customer requirements can be adopted.

### Technical and Functional Spikes

Spikes primarily come in two forms: technical and functional.
 #### Functional spikes
* They are used to analyze overall solution behavior and determine: How to break it down How to organize the work Where risk and complexity exist How to use insights to influence implementation decisions
#### Technical spike
* They are used to research various approaches in the solution domain. For example: Determine a build-versus-buy decision Evaluate the potential performance or load impact of a new user story Evaluate specific technical implementation approaches Develop confidence about the desired solution path

### When to do technical spike

* Your team is having trouble estimating stories effectively. There are many wildly different opinions on the size of user stories. Consider a spike and rely on expert opinion instead of consensus based estimation like Planning Poker
* The story point estimate is unrealistically high, to sandbag FUD — fear, doubt and uncertainty. Use technical spike to dispel FUD, then estimate.
* Feedback from retrospectives to explore better ways of handling accidental complexity. During sprint planning, allocate time to reduce tech debt
### How
* pair up with someone and spike on different approaches to solve the same problem.
* explore at least two solutions and preferably three.
* Avoid investigating without sharing and make the best use of technical spike to hone your technical presentation skills.
## Ex

**As a client looking to hire a team of developers**

_I want to be able to contact the developers by filling out and submitting a form by providing my name, email and message information

So that the team have sufficient information to contact me afterwards_
