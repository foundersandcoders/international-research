# Unit Test 
 are conducted by developers and test the unit of code( aka module, component) he or she developed. It is a testing method by which individual units of source code are tested to determine if they are ready to use. It helps to reduce the cost of bug fixes since the bugs are identified during the early phases of development life cycle.

 # Integration testing 
 is executed by testers and tests integration between software modules. It is a software testing technique where individual units of a program are combined and tested as a group. Test softwares are used to assist in Integration Testing.

<!-- Tables -->
| Unit Testing     | Integration testing          |
| -------- | -------------- |
| The idea behind Unit Testing is to test each part of the program and show that the individual parts are correct.| The idea behind Integration Testing is to combine modules in the application and test as a group to see that they are working fine |
| It can be performed at any time| It usually done after Unit Testing  |
| It pays attention to the behavior of single modules | It pays attention to integration among modules |
| It is usually executed by developer | it done by team |
