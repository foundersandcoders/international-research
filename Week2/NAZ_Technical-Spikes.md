## Technical spikes research checklist

- [x] What are technical spikes?
- [x] When and why would a spike be useful?
- [x] How would you successfully spike on a topic?
- [x] Give an example of how a spike could have helped with last week's projects.

## What is a technical spike?
A technical spike is used during project planning to investigate potential solutions to a problem. It's a small and isolated experiment outside of the normal project environment used to test/demonstrate the feature in question.

The Project Lead allocates a little bit of the teamâ€™s capacity now, ahead of when the story needs to be delivered, so that when it comes to it, the team knows what to do.


## When to do a technical spike?

When you are planning a project and you are unsure if:
* A proposed solution is technically possible
* How long it will take
* The solution chosen is the best solution

Although technical spike is short by definition, collectively several spikes can be very time consuming. They should therefore be used selectively. There is no need to use a technical spike for a technology you already understand well.

It is bad practice to copy your spike code in to your main project.
Focus your work on answering a specific technical question, and stop working on the spike as soon as it answers that question. You should use Testing Driven Development, keeping in mind what you have learnt from your technical spike.


## How to successfully spike a topic

1. Identify the gap(s) in knowledge and qualify the need for a spike
2. Top-level research into possible solution(s)
3. Implement an isolated spike
5. Capture learnings for use in the main project (don't use spike code)


## Why would a spike be useful?


#### Spikes allow you to ignore the complexities of your project
When you clarify technical questions with well-directed, isolated experiments, you spend less time speculating about how your program will work. You focus your debugging and exploratory programming on the problem at hand rather than the ways in which your production code might be interacting with your experiment.

#### Spikes move your understanding from theoretical to the practical
You can read tutorials as you like, but nothing helps you understand a problem more than writing working code. It's important to work from a practical point of view, not just a theoretical one. You don't have to write good code, just focus on short-term results.

#### They are often required in order to move on with your project
