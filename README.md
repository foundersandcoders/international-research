# International_Research

Repository for FAC campuses to share the results of their research topics.

This repository holds a folder for each of the seven weeks of the FAC curricululm that cohorts conduct research (weeks 1 - 8 minus week 3).

Each FAC campus (Nazareth, Gaza and London) will use this resource to share the results of the research afternoon for the week. The purpose is to make sure that all the campuses are aware of each other and to open the possibility of exchange between them.

Each group at each campus should produce a markdown file containing the research output of their topic for that week and push the file to master branch within the relevant week folder, a naming convention should be followed, to be detailed below.

**THIS IS THE ONLY OCCASION THAT YOU SHOULD THINK IT IS OK TO PUSH TO MASTER!!**

At the end of the week the relevant folder should contain 12 files: 4 each for each of the campuses (assuming four topics are researched each week).

The naming convention is as follows:

**[Campus Code]\_[Topic].md**

Campus codes are: **NAZ**, **GAZ**, **LON**

Topics are as written in the repository with hyphens for spaces.

Examples:

- NAZ_Regular-Expressions.md (week 1)
- LON_Packaging.md (week 4)
- GAZ_Web-Storage.md (week 7)

As the header of the file please include the campus/cohort code, the topic, and the date.

Examples:

- FACN4 Regular Expressions [the date d-m-y]
- FAC14 Packaging [the date d-m-y]
- FACG5 Web Storage [the date d-m-y]
