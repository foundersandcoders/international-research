# Server Request Research

---

## Making API requests from a server

### Why request from the back-end anyway?

---

* Making third party API calls from the client side is an example of 'Cross-Origin Resource Sharing' AKA CORS. Avoiding CORS and making calls from the server means:
    * You can re-use the response in the server for other things. If it's only in the client it's not as useful.
    * It hides your API keys from the client and is much more secure (minimises the possibility of cross-site-scripting)

---

**From the perspective of a developer:**
* Node and package methods make the requests super clean and way shorter!
* Keeps your client-side code clean and just concerned with rendering.
* Calls are quicker!
* You can package up your API requests in the most efficient way to be used client side

## Demo Time!

### Advantage of 'Request' npm package (over native node methods):
* Works with http or https, you don't have to specify
* You don't need to handle a stream (i.e. use data chunking)
* Fewer lines of code (we used 4)
* We think it looks more readable!

---

*Only minor beef is that **request** is a commonly used variable so can potentially get a bit confusing. But you can define it whatever you want, so...*

### Comparison Articles:

[Article containing 5 options](https://www.valentinog.com/blog/http-requests-node-js-async-await/) - https.get (native), request module (lots of dependencies, no promise support), node-fetch (popular, supports promises!)



[Useful Twilio article](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/08/http-requests-in-node-js.html)
Also lists 5 interesting options, and they use NASA’s Astronomy Picture of the Day API as the JSON API to interacting with in all of the examples.
